# Arduino-Robot-Servo
This is a program for an Arduino controlled robot that utalises a servo motor to turn an ultrasonic sensor without the use of a libary for the servo
it that the the plus times of the servo and utalises those timing to alllow the arduino to move and turn the servo at the same time,  this is beacuse the aruino i am  using utalise3s the motor file that runs on two seperarte time channels (idk the proper name)
this is beacause the Atmega32U for some reason only has 2 timing thing and so we needed to vcode it so that there wouldn't be an issue
